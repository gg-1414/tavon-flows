          <p>Hi I’m TaVon! </p>
          <p>I have been tracuer, or rather practitioner of parkour for the last 15 years and 3x consecutive speed USA 🇺🇸 Parkour Championship 👑🤴🏽. I was the first captain of The Boys 🏴‍☠️, the first invited USA team to play 🗺 World Chase Tag 🌐.  I have had the fortunate opportunity of traveling the world doing what I love.</p>
          <p> I recently did a TV show Ultimate Tag where I was casted to play 🌊 The Flow 🌊 where I honestly just had to play as myself. Win-win! </p>
